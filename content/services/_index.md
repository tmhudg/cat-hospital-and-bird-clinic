### Care
{{< figure src="/images/Care2.png" class="left-pic" >}}At the Worcester Cat Hospital and Bird Clinic, we understand bringing your cat to the vet can be stressful for you and your feline friend. Since we cater to felines (sorry, no canines here), we find our patients to be generally calmer and at ease in our cat only atmosphere.

In mixed practice clinics, cats are often seen and treated as small dogs. Since we are able to concentrate on cats, our knowledge and procedures are state of the art for felines – whether treating the feline diabetic, geriatric patient with diseases like thyroid and kidney disease, or helping our clients with the basics on caring for their new kitten.

We have many cats with special needs board with us to ensure their medications and problems are carefully monitored when their families travel. Bringing your feline friend to our hospital means giving them the care and expertise only a Cat Hospital can provide.

### Birds and Exotics
{{< figure src="/images/greeniguana.png" class="left-pic" >}}Approximately fifty percent of the caseload at the Worcester Cat Hospital and Bird Clinic is comprised of exotic pets. As a long standing AAV member (the veterinary organization dedicated to Avian and exotic species) Dr. O’Leary has attended hundereds of hours of continuing education for avian and exotic animal medicine and surgery.

She is a published author for a Reptile Medicine text and is part of a veterinary network through VIN (Veterinary Information Network), where a panel of Specialists are able to share and discuss the problems and issues of Avian and Exotic species with fellow experts in the field.

Each staff member at the Worcester Cat Hospital and Bird Clinic is thoroughly trained in the diets, husbandry (general care), needs and problems of the various species we see, in order that you, our client, has the resources you need to properly care for your special pet. Snake or lizard, guniea pig, hedgehog, budgie or macaw…we see them all.
