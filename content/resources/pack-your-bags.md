## But don’t let your pet pack on the holiday pounds.

### Schedule your pet’s yearly checkup today.

Holiday season is upon us — a busy time of year for festivities, family and of course, lots of eating! Did you know that if a ten-pound cat ate just one ounce of cheddar cheese from your hors d’oeuvres, it would be the same as if a person ate three and a half hamburgers or four chocolate bars? Gaining those “holiday pounds” is not just a problem for humans, but also for our four-legged friends.
Research shows that pets are more likely to gain unwanted pounds during this holiday period than any other time of year. What pet can resist a potato chip, onion dip or chocolate? (Wait, you know better than to feed them that!)

Obesity is the leading medical problem in pets. When a pet is too chubby, not only may they have little energy to walk or play, but also studies have shown that pets who are overweight may have a shortened life span.

How can you tell if your pet is at the right weight?

It can be hard to know because for many pets, they don’t get a big round belly. Instead, the extra fat is well hidden inside your pet’s body, tucked between their vital organs. So let us check! Our veterinary practice team has a trained eye to best assess your pet’s weight. Bring your pet in for their yearly exam and we’ll take a look at their body condition and nutritional needs. If we determine your pet needs to lose a few pounds, don’t worry. We’ll come up with a plan that will keep you and your pet sailing through the holiday season.

Call us today to schedule your pet’s yearly checkup. Happy holidays and remember, pack your suitcase. Pack a trunk. It’s even fine to pack a sleigh. But don’t let your pet pack on the pounds!
