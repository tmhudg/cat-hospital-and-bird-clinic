## Let’s make sure your pet is healthy all over. Schedule your pet’s yearly checkup today!

September is when kids go back to school, and finally, you have a chance to relax. Who wants to join you? Your pet! While your snuggling with your furry friend, you may feel a bump or rash on their skin. What should you do?

Your pet may have bumps. Lumps. Missing fur. A black spot. A funny-looking toenail. Are these things nothing, or something of concern? For most owners, it’s tough to know what skin issues are ok and what needs further evaluation. Missing fur may be from a lost battle with a housemate. A black spot may be a tick. A rash may indicate a food allergy. A little bump may be cancer. Skin is the largest organ of the body and there’s a lot to cover! That’s why a yearly checkup is vital to your pet’s health. When you bring your pet in for their wellness exam, we’ll assess every part of them, from nose to tail. We’ll make sure your pet is healthy and stays that way!

Now that there’s a little peace and quiet at home, schedule your pet’s yearly exam. We’ll perform a thorough skin check and a few other easy tests if needed to keep your pet happy, healthy and a part of your family for a long, long time. Make an appointment today!
