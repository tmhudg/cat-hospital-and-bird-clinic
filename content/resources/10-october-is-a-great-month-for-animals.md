It’s National Service Dog Month, National Animal Safety and Protection Month, ASPCA’s Adopt a Shelter Dog Month and there’s even a shout-out to cats this month on National Cat Day, October 29. With all of these warm and fuzzy feelings circulating in the autumn air, it’s a perfect time to take a good, hard look at your pet. How has he/she been acting lately?

Nipping. Scratching. Litter box issues. Leash pulling. Meowing at night. Urinating on the floor. Chewing shoes. Are these behaviors just part of being a “normal” dog or cat, or not?

Some common behavior issues are due to underlying medical problems. These illnesses are tough to recognize even for the most observant owners. For example, if your dog started nipping at the kids, it may be a sign he’s in pain. Your cat may stop jumping on your lap. Not because she’s being unfriendly, but because she has arthritis and it hurts.

If these behaviors are left unchecked, it’s a triple issue. The behavior may worsen, the underlying medical condition may progress (which puts your pet’s health at risk), and most importantly, your pet’s quality of life as part of your family is compromised.
