<h3>Care</h3>
<figure class="left-pic">

</figure> 
<p>At the Worcester Cat Hospital and Bird Clinic, we understand bringing your cat to the vet can be 
stressful for you and your feline friend. Since we cater to felines (sorry, no canines here), we 
find our patients to be generally calmer and at ease in our cat only atmosphere.</p>
<p>In mixed practice clinics, cats are often seen and treated as small dogs. Since we are able to 
	concentrate on cats, our knowledge and procedures are state of the art for felines – whether 
	treating the feline diabetic, geriatric patient with diseases like thyroid and kidney 
	disease, or helping our clients with the basics on caring for their new kitten.</p>
<p>We have many cats with special needs board with us to ensure their medications and problems 
	are carefully monitored when their families travel. Bringing your feline friend to our 
	hospital means giving them the care and expertise only a Cat Hospital can provide.</p>
